                <p>True #MadeInItaly girl - Born and raised in Rome, Italy until I realized that I couldn't be in the same place for too long. At 17 I left for one year of High School in Wisconsin, I came back to Rome for my Bachelor Degree in Business Administration from John Cabot University, while playing basketball professionally.</p>
               <p> My career ended when I decided to go study abroad at University of Miami #GoCanes and then to start my Master in Global Management and travel around the world while studying between three partner business schools in NYC, Belgium and India. </p>
               <p> I started working for a consulting firm in NYC, where I helped open up the market for small Italian companies that wanted to expand to the US. After a small parenthesis in Florida, I moved back to NY and started working as Director for the Life Science division at TransPerfect, one of the largest language service providers in the world. </p>
               <p> In my free time, I love working out & running, I ran the NYC Half Marathon last year and am training for the 2019 NYC Marathon. I love to explore the City, restaurants, boutique stores and travel around the world. </p>
               <p> My personal motto is <i>“Per Asper Ad Astra”.</i></p>
